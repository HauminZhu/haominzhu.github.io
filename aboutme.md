In this project, I implemented an UKF algorithm that estimates the orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) using the data from IMU; also implemented an image stitching algorithm to generate a panorama image using the UKF estimate rotation matrix with corresponding camera data:
* Use a data checking algorithm to find the bias of the IMU data, accelerometer and gyroscope separately.
* Use a data converting algorithm to get rid of the bias from image data.
* Use Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm to find optimal parameters for orientation estimation.
* Do image stitching (image stitching.py) to stitch camera image to a panorama one using the orientation tracked from UKF algorithm.
