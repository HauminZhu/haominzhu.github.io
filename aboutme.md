> In this project, I implemented an UKF algorithm that estimates the 3D orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) of robot using data from gyroscopes and accelerometers, we will estimation the underlying 3D orientation by learning the appropriate models parameters from the ground truth given by a Vicon motion capture system. And then using estimation to generate a real-time panoramic image from camera. More detalis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5SvcSBA19LULOKvvoPVM_jdCfaBRu-j/view?usp=sharing).
