## Reserch and Projects
> ### A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 
> #### 不积跬步无以至千里

### Event-based Camera Model with Conditional Adversarial Networks (ongoing)
> Conditional GAN for event-based camera model generation. Details are upcoming.

> The [ABU Robocon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GchwbtfqDzc) was conducted on 24 August 2014 at Pune, India. The Theme for Robocon 2014 declared by India was "A Salute for Parenthood". As a member of competative robotics lab of USTB, I participated in manually and automatic robots design, building. We built one manully controlled 'mother' robot which can holds the fully-automatic 'baby' robot to different mission fields and let the 'baby' automatically finish required tasks. I also took charge of the related student research training program of omni-bearing mobil chassis design and control algoithm development which is used on 'mother' robot.

### Unscented Kalman Filter Based Robot Orientation Estimation and Scene Panorama

> In this project, I implemented an UKF algorithm that estimates the 3D orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) of robot using data from gyroscopes and accelerometers, we will estimation the underlying 3D orientation by learning the appropriate models parameters from the ground truth given by a Vicon motion capture system. And then using estimation to generate a real-time panoramic image from camera. More detalis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5SvcSBA19LULOKvvoPVM_jdCfaBRu-j/view?usp=sharing).
