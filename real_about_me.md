## Basketball
I love basketball and used to be member of high school and university school basketball team.

Also I'm super and crazy fan of Kobe starting from 2007. The reason I become a Kobe fan is not only his championships, his magnificent moves, his excellent techniques, but also his **passion**, his **courage**, his the **pursuit of perfection** and his **unyeilding spirit**.
