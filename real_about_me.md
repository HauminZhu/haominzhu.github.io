# Basketball
I love basketball and used to be member of high school and university school basketball team.

Also I'm super and crazy fan of Kobe starting from 2007. The reason I become a Kobe fan is not only his championships, his magnificent moves, his excellent techniques, but also his **passion**, his **courage**, his **pursuit of perfection** and his **unyeilding spirit**.

# Gundam $ Gunpla
![gundam](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/0/03/Rxuc-ova-ntd.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20160225044457)

Maybe Gundam is the very beginning source where my interests of robotics comes from.
