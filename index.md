## May the force be with you!

I'm **Haomin (Haumin) Zhu**, current **Computer Science** and **Robotics** student at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised Prof. [Kostas Daniilidis](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). 

Before coming to Penn, I graduated from [University of Science and Technology, Beijing (USTB)](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/) with the highest honor [**Golden Presidential Medal**](http://xyzx.ustb.edu.cn/xuexiyuandi/xiangyata/shushanzhumeng/2016-10-18/81.html). At USTB I majored in **Mechanical Engineering and Automation** advised by Prof. [Jiang Li](http://me.ustb.edu.cn/shiziduiwu/quantijiaoshi/2016-09-27/120.html) and worked for [ABU ROBOCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) Robot Contest at Competative Robotics Lab of USTB. 

My background is super interdisciplinary (**CS, EE, ME**). I have much experience of projects and research in roboics, computer vision, learning and mechatronics. Currently my research interests lie in learning (especially generative models) in computer vision, robotics and control. 

I'm enthusiastic in developing and applying all kinds of learning algorithm to real robots especiall ones used in service, human-assisting fields. I want to develop the **highly-intelligent robots** can be **better controlled, understand and interact with human**.
