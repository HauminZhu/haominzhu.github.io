## Overview

**Welcome!** I'm **Haomin (Haumin) Zhu**, current **Computer Science** and **Robotics** student at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised Prof. [Kostas Daniilidis](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). 

Before coming to Penn, I graduated from [University of Science and Technology, Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/) (USTB) with highest honor **Golden Presidential Medal**. At USTB I majored in **Mechanical Engineering and Automation** advised by Prof. [Jiang Li](http://me.ustb.edu.cn/shiziduiwu/quantijiaoshi/2016-09-27/120.html) and worked for [ABU ROBOCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) Robot Contest at Competative Robotics Lab of USTB. 

My background is super interdisciplinary, I have much experience of projects and research in roboics, computer vision, learning and mechatronics. Currently my research interests lie in learning (especially generative models) in computer vision, robotics and control. I'm enthusiasm in developing and applying all kinds of learning algorithm to real robot especiall ones used in service, human-assisting fields.
